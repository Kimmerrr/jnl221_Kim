	<h1>Latest Fed Increase Came Down to the Wire. ‘That Was a Rough Weekend.’</h1>
	<h2>Jerome Powell and other officials waited and watched the fallout from SVB, Swiss bank crisis, finally deciding the financial system was stable enough to raise rates</h2>

	<p> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues faced their closest call on interest rates in years. It wasn’t until the clock was ticking down two days before their scheduled decision last month that senior leaders settled on a plan to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-rates-but-nods-to-greater-uncertainty-after-banking-stress-6ae9316f?mod=article_inline"> lift them by a quarter percentage point</a>. <br><br>
	That was down to the wire in Fed time. Rate-setting meetings are usually tightly choreographed and devoid of suspense. The big decisions happen in the week leading up to the gathering and not during the two days of elaborate presentations and discussion around the boardroom table. Fed leaders like to avoid surprises so they can fine-tune their public message. <br><br>
	The run-up to their March 21-22 meeting, which was dominated by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-walks-tightrope-between-inflation-and-financial-instabilitybut-for-how-long-789283d0?mod=article_inline"> concerns about the banking system crisis</a> that had erupted two weeks erlier, was the opposite.
	The decision, on the heels of rolling out new tools to address heightened financial stress, highlighted the flexibility and improvisation that has been a calling card of Mr. Powell during his five years at the top of the central bank. <br><br>
	Pushing ahead with the rate increase demonstrated the Fed’s desire to avoid falling behind in its fight against inflation. It could also give officials more flexibility to forgo an increase at the next meeting, on May 2-3, if they see evidence that tighter bank-lending conditions are slowing the economy.<br><br>
	In March, Fed officials weighed two policy options ahead of the meeting: Raise rates by a quarter point, while signaling uncertainty about how much more to lift them, or hold rates steady and increase them at their next meeting.<br><br>
	They came to their decision Monday, March 20, only after it appeared <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubs-credit-suisse-rescue-switzerland-banks-36abe8c4?mod=article_inline"> Swiss authorities had stemmed a dangerous decline in confidence</a> in the global banking system with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubs-offers-1-billion-to-take-over-credit-suisse-bfac51fa?mod=article_inline">forced acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG by its longtime rival UBS Group AG</a> the night before. <br><br>
	The Swiss bank deal came a week after the Fed’s intervention to stabilize the U.S. banking system following the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-last-ditch-effort-to-save-silicon-valley-bank-failed-89619cb2?mod=article_inline">failure of two midsize American banks</a>. The Swiss merger marked the first combination of two systemically important global banks, sometimes called “G-SIBs,” since the 2008 financial crisis. <br><br>
	“If I had woken up Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning and felt like there was a global G-SIB challenge, then I clearly would’ve seen the case for pausing” rate increases, said Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, referring to the Fed meeting days.  <br><br>
	Instead, he said, financial turmoil “seemed to have calmed down, and I convinced myself that you had a resilient banking sector and too high inflation, and so why wouldn’t you continue to fight inflation?” <br><br>
	This article is based on interviews with Fed officials, who described how they reached their decision. <br><br>

	At the conclusion of the Fed’s previous policy meeting, on Feb. 1, officials approved a quarter-point rate rise, the smallest since March 2022. They slowed their rapid-fire pace of increases to allow more time to study the effects of those moves on the economy. <br><br>
	On Feb. 3, officials were stunned by a blowout report on January hiring, which pointed to much stronger labor demand than expected. Soon followed other reports showing inflation hadn’t fallen as much as anticipated in the fourth quarter and that consumer spending growth and inflation had accelerated in January. <br><br>
	At a policy conference in Manhattan in late February, one longtime associate asked Fed governor Christopher Waller how he was doing. “Great until February 3,” Mr. Waller replied. <br><br>
	<h2>Losing ground to inflation <br><br>
	</h2>
	<p>
	Mr. Powell concluded that the Fed would have to consider a half-point rate rise in March or risk losing ground to inflation. <br><br>
	Fed officials had said publicly they expected to lift their benchmark federal-funds rate above 5% this year. “So why not get there sooner rather than later,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he thought. He had favored a half-point rate rise at the March meeting until the bank failures. <br><br>
	Mr. Powell opened the door to a half-point increase during a March 7 hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. “Nothing about the data suggests to me that we’ve tightened too much,” he told lawmakers.<br><br>
	After investors assumed he meant an increase of a half point, or 50 basis points, was likely, Mr. Powell stressed the next day during his testimony that no decision had been made.<br><br>
	The call appeared likely to hinge on inflation reports due the week of March 13, after officials had begun their traditional pre-meeting quiet period.<br><br>
	“The case was between 25 and 50” basis points, said Mr. Barkin. “I like the notion of a flatter path because it gives you more time to understand and less cost if you’re wrong, so I probably was hoping for a set of [inflation] readings that would support that path.” <br><br>
	Everything changed on Thursday, March 9. After <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-bank-svb-financial-what-is-happening-299e9b65?mod=article_inline">Silicon Valley Bank disclosed it would raise capital</a> and register losses on securities that had fallen in value, panicked depositors—largely startups funded by venture-capital firms—started a run on the bank that resulted in a shocking $42 billion being pulled by day’s end. The bank told the Fed it anticipated another $100 billion in outflows on Friday, March 10, and regulators closed the bank before the start of business.
